This research project is dedicated to the computation of the **Mertens function**.

It was my Bachelor's thesis at the University Paris Cité, under the supervision of [Cathy Swaenepoel](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~cathy.swaenepoel/).

The Mertens function is defined as \\(M(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{x} \mu(n)\\), where \\(\mu(n)\\) is the Möbius function.

In this project, I explore a computational method and theoretical aspects related to the Mertens function and this computation.

All details about the project are provided in the report, and you can find the complete source code and presentation slides in this directory [mertens](https://github.com/plvie/school_project/tree/main/mertens).

## Source Code

The source code is written in C and optimized for performance. You can find the main implementation here:
